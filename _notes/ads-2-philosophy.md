First generation ads used to be in the lines of "buy my product because my product is kickass". My product has this, has that. It is better than all competitors etc. 

Ads 2.0 took a different spin. It became "My product is not kickass, but it makes you kickass". Buy this toothpaste, you get a girlfriend. Buy this energy drink, you win a race etc.
