I have been terrible at keeping this blog alive. But then again, I don't want to add pressure on me to write something everyday. I already have a huge list of things to get done by end of 2024. 

Recently, I have first hand experienced what happens when you over-hire people in an org. To justify their head count, people start making everything complex and a blackbox. People start using statements like "we have to check if it is good", "I don't think it is working" etc. Nothing irritates me more than when people use vague statements. I always ask them, to their annoyment "what do you mean by good?", "why do you think it is not working?". 

Nothing drains me more than a big team.
