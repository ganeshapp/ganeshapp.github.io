Started [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) 2024. The first problem was not too bad. This time using just python and not experimenting with other languages. I think for the rest of the month this will keep me busy. I also plan to visit my mom over the winter holidays. It isn't exactly holidays, but I things will be slow at work and I should be able to work from home. Also I think I am far more productive in hotter climates than in Korea. Sub-zero temperatures make me ultra lazy. When the sun goes down at 5pm and it is super dark, it seems like the day is over.

Working out at home is also a pain during winter. I prefer running outside, but that is not possible these days. So I look forward to running when I visit my mom.
