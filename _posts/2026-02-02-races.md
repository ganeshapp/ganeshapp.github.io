So I registered for a bunch of races in 2026 and I plan to run at least 1 or 2 races per month starting March. I think I will do a lot of 10K and Half marathons and a few Marathons and at least one Ultra. 

March 7th: [Korea Open Race](http://www.koreaopenrace.com/dorun/info.php) - Half Marathon
March 21st: [Bucket Run](https://www.aramarathon.com/main/main.php) - 10K

This also means I need to start training regularly to always be race ready. For the first race in March, I have about 5 weeks. And below is my training plan:

Because the race is on March 7th, it is a short timeframe, I am sharpening my current fitness and getting myself comfortable holding a faster pace. 

Key Treadmill Speed Conversions
- Easy/Recovery: 10.0 – 11.5 km/h
- Goal Race Pace (Tempo): 13.8 – 14.2 km/h (Let's call this 14 km/h)
- Speed/Intervals: 15.0 – 16.5+ km/h

## Notes

1. Rowing Warm-up: 5 minutes total. Minute 1 easy, Minute 2 medium, Minute 3 hard, Minute 4 easy, Minute 5 hard sprint. Then get off and lift weights.

2. **Key Exercise 1:** Bulgarian Split Squats (holding dumbbells). Essential for runners.

3. **Key Exercise 2:** Single-Leg Deadlifts (with kettlebell or dumbbell). Prevents hamstring injuries.

4. **Key Exercise 3:** Plank Drag-throughs (using the kettlebell).

5. **Routine:** Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps. We want muscular endurance, not bulk, for the race.

6. **Incline on Treadmill:** For all "Easy" and "Long" runs, set the incline to 0.5% or 1.0%. This mimics air resistance outdoors. For interval days (speed), you can leave it flat (0%) to maximize leg turnover speed.

7. **The "Essential 4" Daily Routine (5 Minutes):** Immediately after every run or bike session while your muscles are still warm. Hold each stretch for 45–60 seconds.

8. **The Treadmill Calf Stretch (Calves):**
**Why:** The treadmill belt pulls your foot back, overworking the calves.

**How:** Stand on the edge of the treadmill (or a step). Drop one heel off the edge until you feel a deep stretch in the lower leg. Keep the leg straight. Switch legs.

9. **The Couch Stretch (Hip Flexors)**

**Why:** Running fast (14km/h+) tightens the hips. Tight hips lead to lower back pain.

**How:** Kneel on the floor facing away from your treadmill or a wall. Put one knee on the floor and your foot up against the wall/machine behind you. Squeeze your glute and push your hips forward. You should feel a massive pull in the front of the thigh/hip.

10. **Lying Hamstring Stretch (Using your Resistance Bands)**

**Why:** To prevent knee pain and improve stride length.

**How:** Lie on your back. Loop a resistance band around one foot. Keep that leg straight and pull it towards your face using the band. Keep your butt on the floor. This is much better than trying to touch your toes while standing.

11. **The Dead Hang (Using your Pull-Up Bar)**

**Why:** Running compresses your spine. This decompresses it.

**How:** Simply grab your pull-up bar and hang loosely for 30–60 seconds. Let your body weight stretch out your back and shoulders. Do not do a pull-up; just hang.

12. **The Friday "Deep Reset"**

**Deep Squat Hold:** Hold a deep squat (use your kettlebell as a counterbalance weight in front of you) for 2 minutes to open up hips and ankles.

**Pigeon Pose:** On the floor, brings one leg in front bent at 90 degrees. Leaning forward. Great for the glutes.

**Cat-Cow:** On all fours, arching and rounding your back.
