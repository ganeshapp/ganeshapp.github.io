Another trip around the sun and honestly compared to 2024, I feel 2025 was more memorable. I didn't travel as much as I did in 2024. But it was an interesting year.

Things I made:
1. [ball-park](https://www.gapp.in/ballpark). It is an app to train mental math, especially big number math. The idea is to get an [approximate answer quickly](https://www.gapp.in/projects/ballpark/). It is local first, no registration, private.
2. [Back of The Napkin](https://www.gapp.in/napkin/). It is a webapp to do [guesstimations (sizing an opportunity)](https://www.gapp.in/projects/back_of_the_napkin/). The key was to make it sharable and editable without having to create an account. And assure privacy based on deniability. 
3. [Wiki](https://www.gapp.in/wiki/). Sometimes, I would get deeply interested in some topic and go down the rabbit hole. I figured having my obsidian published to my website would help me access these deep research. This is also part of keeping my [Digital Garden](https://www.gapp.in/notes/digital-garden/) growing.
4. [Korean Language Learning App](https://github.com/ganeshapp/language). It combines audio and anki cards. 
5. Many random tiny tools, like a tool to get [interesting hacker news articles and their comment threads](https://github.com/ganeshapp/hn), a tool to [train GTO poker](https://www.gapp.in/poker/), a tool to train chess openings, a tool to [write like a human on a whiteboard](https://www.gapp.in/katexwhiteboard/) and many other such silly things.  

I got really good at cooking Indian food. I was always a pretty good cook. But I mostly ate out or cooked simple western dishes. In 2025 I went full south indian. Sambhar, Rasam, dosai, fish curry, poriyal, kootu etc. 

I also [ran a race](https://www.gapp.in/blog/gangnam-marathon/) after 5-6 years. I got pretty fit and got my resting heart rate to be around 41-43. Made a lot of new friends and reconnected with some very old friends.

For this year, I plan to run a few more races. I also plan to contribute to some open source software. And most importantly dabble a lot with hardware.
