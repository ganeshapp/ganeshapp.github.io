After a long time I decided to participate in a race. I picked the [Gangnam Peace Marathon](https://peacemarathon.co.kr/) because it was like right across the river from my place and the start time was 9am. The weather wasn't the greatest. It was raining. So I decided I will just do the half marathon. 

It was a good experience. A lot of fun. I am happy with the time of 1:34 for a half. I wasn't even tired or anything at the end of the race. So I could have pushed myself and done it in 1:24 or something. 

Anyway, I think I will get back to running more races in the coming months.
