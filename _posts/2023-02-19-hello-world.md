I decided to redo my entire website today optimising for Obsidian. The previous site was made for github and then I tried to fit in Obsidian notes and things got out of hand. The structure was messy. Things were broken and I had no motivation to even open it up and write stuff, because it was overwhelming to clean it up.

As with any new setup, there is plenty of things to learn. I have been googling quite a bit to make things work and I think I enjoy this process the most. The "aha" moment, when something wasn't working for quite some time and then you find some random website that tells you add this piece of code and it starts to work, is a very underrated form of joy.
