Now that the website is setup and the structure seems to be working quite well with Obsidian, I think I will start adding notes with a theme. The theme needs to be broad enough to capture all my interests, especially my online reading and information consumption. But I don't want it to be a data dump. I want to process the information that I consume. I think a good theme could be to make mathematical models of all of information that I consume. Breaking down industries, process, ideas into fundamentals and reconstructing them will help me process the information as well as create mental models.
