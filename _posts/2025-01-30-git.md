So the chinese new year holidays are over. 

I finally learned git. I know it is a basic skill. And I have been using it for over 10 years. But I never really bothered to learn it in depth. I was happy with just the basic add, commit, push, pull commands. But I finally learned how to use branches and merge them and all that stuff. I finally documented everything I learned about Git [here](https://www.gapp.in/TIL/git-and-github/)

Even though it would seem I have not made any progress on the side quest of making a flutter app for improving mental math skills, I have learned quite a bit about flutter and github pages and making an app that is for both mobile and web using the same codebase.

I haven't had any success with github actions to auto deploy my flutter app to github pages. I tried many ways, but everything leads to errors and the AI chat bots like openai and gemini are not able to help me. I guess I will have to learn it myself. There is no shortcut to github actions. And I have created a new page for github actions [here](https://www.gapp.in/TIL/github-actions/) similar to the git page. Hopefully, the digital garden will grow and not die. 

My investments in Indian stock market is tanking. Brother says it has to do with the budget. Anyway they were long term investments and so I am not worried. 

I finally got myself a ["Now" page](https://www.gapp.in/Now/Now/). I hope to keep it updated at a frequency of once a month.
