At different phases of my life, every month has had something special to look forward to. In my 20s: January was for Mumbai Marathon, February was for Auroville marathon, Auroville Ultimate Frisbee tournament and Auroville Argentine Tango festival, March was for [Twilight Ultra](https://www.twilightultrachallenge.com/), May was for Kodi Flybaba Ultimate frisbee tournament, August was [Bedok Ultra](https://bedokultra.blogspot.com/p/results.html), November was for [NaNoWriMo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month) and [Movember](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movember) etc.

As a kid the highlight of December was bro's birthday. Then it was Chennai International Film Festival during college days. Then it was the McRitchie Ultra etc. But for the last 10 year it has been [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

AOC is pretty much what I look forward to in Dec. Every year it has helped me learn a new language: Python in 2016, Erlang in 2017, JS in 2018, Dart in 2022.

This year, the plan was to learn either Go or Rust. But pity is I haven't even found the time to start. It is already Dec 11th and I haven't even done one of the puzzles. Such a shame.
