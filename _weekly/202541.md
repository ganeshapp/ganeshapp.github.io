## [Social Cooling](https://www.socialcooling.com/)

In a world where everything is recorded, rated, and remembered, people begin to perform rather than live. Every action becomes a data point; every opinion, a potential liability. The result is social cooling — a quiet behavioral shift where we say less, risk less, and conform more.

Once, the pressure to fit in came from the small communities we belonged to. Now it comes from invisible algorithms and abstract audiences. The “herd” is no longer made of friends or neighbors, but of metrics — likes, engagement scores, and corporate filters that decide what is “appropriate.” Even rebellion has become a brand, optimized for attention and monetized through outrage.

This doesn’t mean society has grown polite or reasonable. In many spaces, people burn hot within their tribes and go cold outside them. We are fragmented, each group enforcing its own consensus, each individual cautious about stepping across invisible lines.

Technology didn’t invent conformity; it industrialized it. Surveillance used to mean a watchful eye. Now it means the constant possibility of being seen — by employers, governments, or machines that analyze tone and sentiment. Under such conditions, spontaneity withers. We learn to edit ourselves before speaking.

Social cooling isn’t censorship by force; it’s self-censorship by design. And the cost is subtle but profound: fewer bold ideas, fewer genuine mistakes, fewer honest conversations. A society that fears being wrong soon forgets how to be right.

## The Quiet Resilience of RSS

In a digital world ruled by algorithms, RSS remains an act of quiet rebellion. It restores the simplest idea of the web — that you, not a platform, decide what to read and when to read it. Free from recommendation engines and engagement traps, RSS offers something that social media cannot: sovereignty over your attention.

For those who rediscover it, RSS becomes both sanctuary and discipline. You curate your own feed, prune noisy sources, and rediscover the slower rhythm of the old web — when reading was intentional, not reactive. A good feed reader becomes less like a dopamine slot machine and more like a well-tended garden.

Yet the technology’s endurance is not nostalgia. It’s evolution through minimalism: open standards, self-hosted servers, small but thriving ecosystems of independent developers. Some dream of federated recommendation systems; others just want clean interfaces that sync across devices. What unites them is a refusal to let algorithms mediate curiosity.

RSS is not about rejecting the modern web — it’s about reclaiming it. It reminds us that discovery doesn’t have to be engineered, that relevance can emerge from habit and care, not metrics. In an era of infinite feeds, control has become the ultimate luxury. And RSS, quietly, still offers it.

So many people are calling for enabling RSS feeds for their blogs and also re-starting the blogroll trend.

## The Discipline of Doing Something Silly

A [quest like doing ten thousand pushups](https://wjgilmore.com/articles/10000-pushups) sounds absurd — until it changes your life. What begins as a joke often becomes structure, and what starts as discipline turns into joy. There’s power in a goal that’s concrete, measurable, and a little bit ridiculous.

Pushups are a metaphor for all the small, repeatable acts that rebuild a body — or a life — from entropy. They require no equipment, no membership, no perfect plan. Just gravity and patience. The challenge is never physical at first; it’s mental. You start with one, then two, and soon you’re tracking progress not because you must, but because it’s satisfying to see the line rise.

Somewhere along the way, the habits spill over. You start sleeping earlier, eating better, skipping the drive-through, and noticing how good it feels to not hurt anymore. Fitness snowballs — effort compounds just like neglect once did.

The wisdom hidden inside these “silly quests” is that self-improvement doesn’t need complexity. It needs friction removed. The easier it is to start, the harder it is to stop.

In the end, ten thousand pushups aren’t really about strength. They’re about proving that the smallest consistent effort, done long enough, will eventually move anything, including you.

## [Living out of a Backpack](https://jeremymaluf.com/onebag/)

1. Pack Half as Much as You Think

Everyone overpacks. You don’t need a week’s worth of clothes—three shirts, two shorts, and one pair of pants will do. Stick to merino wool (Icebreaker, Smartwool, or Unbound Merino) or synthetic techwear (Outlier, Patagonia Capilene). They dry fast, resist odor, and last forever.

A packing rule worth following: If you can’t wash it in a sink and dry it overnight, it doesn’t belong in your bag.

⸻

2. Your Backpack Is a Mobile Apartment

Every item earns its place by doing two jobs. A buff doubles as a sleep mask, a Uniqlo Ultra Light Down jacket works as a pillow, and a quick-dry towel (Sea to Summit) becomes a beach mat.
Choose a pack that’s light but tough — Aer Travel Pack 3, Tortuga, or Osprey Farpoint/Fairview are battle-tested.

⸻

3. Durability Over Optimization

Forget the ultralight obsession. Zippers break faster than you think. Look for YKK zippers, Cordura or ballistic nylon, and muted colors that hide dirt. A slightly heavier pack that never fails is worth more than one that saves 200 grams and rips in week three.

⸻

4. Laundry Beats Luggage

It’s easier to find detergent than space. Carry Dr. Bronner’s soap, a scrubba bag or plain ziplock for washing, and hang things with Sea to Summit clothesline or paracord. Every extra shirt is one more thing you’ll resent halfway up a mountain.

⸻

5. Electricity Is the Real Currency

You can lose your passport and survive. Lose your charge, and you’re blind. Carry two USB-C cables, a GaN charger (Anker Nano II or UGREEN Nexode), and a 20,000mAh power bank. A universal plug (Epicka, MOGICS) is non-negotiable.

⸻

6. Soft Skills Beat Gear

A confident smile, a few phrases in the local language, and the ability to cook with whatever’s in a shared hostel kitchen are worth more than any gadget. The lighter your bag, the more you depend on improvisation — which is the point.

⸻

7. Comfort Kills Adventure

Every convenience adds weight. A little cold, a missed bus, a rainstorm without an umbrella — these are not failures but the texture of travel. Embrace the mild discomfort that keeps you alert and alive.

⸻

8. Leave Room for Serendipity

Never pack to the brim. Keep 20% of your backpack empty and 20% of your schedule unscripted. The best parts of travel are rarely planned: a stranger’s recommendation, an unexpected detour, a slow morning in a new café.

⸻

Minimalism in travel isn’t a competition to carry less. It’s the art of knowing what’s enough. When your pack fits on your shoulders and your life fits in your day, you’re already home.
