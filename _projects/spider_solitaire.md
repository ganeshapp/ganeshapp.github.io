## Spider Solitaire

Decided to make a simple webapp for Spider Solitaire. It is a simple card game that is easy to learn and play. It is a good game to play when you are bored.

I think of all the variants of solitaire, this is the most difficult one. Issue with Spider Solitaire is most random shuffles are not solvable.

I have used a greedy algorithm to check if the game is solvable before serving it to the user. The checking happens within 100ms, so it is fine. It doesn't mean it is easy to solve, but it is atleast solvable. 

This is part of the Zapps collection.
