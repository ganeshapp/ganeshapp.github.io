[Ballpark](https://www.gapp.in/ballpark/) helps you make rough calculations quickly. Instead of exact answer, the idea is to get an approximate answer (within + or - 10% range of the right answer). This is the base requirement for being good at [guesstimation](https://www.gapp.in/napkin/).

BallPark is a completely offline-first app. There are no logins, no servers, and no distractions. All your progress is stored locally on your device. Itâ€™s designed to be your private, focused training ground.


## Features

- **12 Problem Types**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Percentages, Ratios & Fractions, Reverse Percentages, Growth Rate, Compounding, Breakeven, Weighted Average, and Scaling & Conversion
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjustable precision (5% or 10%) and time limits (3 or 5 minutes)
- **A Keypad Built for Speed:** Fumbling with a standard keyboard is slow. Our custom keypad includes shortcuts for Thousands (K), Millions (M), and Billions (B), so you can input large numbers like "$17.5M" in a fraction of the time.

- **Detailed Analytics**: Performance charts and statistics with genre filtering
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on desktop, mobile, and web with keyboard and touch input
